        <div class="mission-statement">
            <p>I document Black American heritage as I encounter it. Monuments, exhibitions, historical photos, cultural moments - preserved and shared as a living archive.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>What This Is</h2>

        <p>This is personal documentation work. When I visit a monument, I photograph it and learn its context. When I attend an exhibition, I capture what's on display. When I find historical photos or documents, I preserve them here.</p>

        <p>It's field work. A running record of what I find significant. Not academic research, not comprehensive coverage - just one person documenting what crosses my path.</p>

        <h2>The Scope</h2>

        <p>I focus on American Descendants of Slavery and post-emancipation Freedmen heritage. The direct line - people whose ancestors were enslaved here, who stayed, who built families and communities on this land across generations.</p>

        <p>That's the through-line. Everything documented here follows that connection.</p>

        <h2>What to Expect</h2>

        <p>Content varies by what I encounter. Some entries are monuments I've visited in Richmond or DC. Some are historical photos I've come across. Some are exhibitions I've attended, with documentation of what was displayed and why it matters.</p>

        <p>There's no posting schedule. Things get added when I document them. Could be weekly, could be monthly. The archive grows as I find material worth preserving.</p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <p>Each documented item includes context - where it is, when I found it, what it represents, why it's here. The goal is to create a searchable, browsable collection that makes this material accessible and preserves it long-term.</p>

        <p>Over time, patterns emerge. Contributions to infrastructure, legal frameworks, cultural innovation, institution-building. The archive shows these connections without having to explain them.</p>
