            <p>I document Black American heritage as I encounter it - monuments I visit, exhibitions I attend, historical photos I find, cultural moments I witness. This is a personal archive of continuity, contribution, and culture.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Why This Exists</h2>

        <p>Black Americans have been present from the earliest stages of this nation. We were here while the country was being built. Our labor constructed the infrastructure. Our innovations shaped the culture. Our lineage developed continuously on this soil across generations.</p>

        <p>Yet our story is often told incompletely - either reduced to suffering alone, or framed as recent arrivals seeking inclusion. Neither captures the reality: we are among the most continuous populations in America, with deeper generational roots than most who claim this country as theirs.</p>

        <p>This archive exists to document that reality. Not to argue for it, but to show it. Through monuments, through historical evidence, through the cultural contributions that are undeniably ours.</p>

        <h2>What I Document</h2>

        <p>I focus specifically on the heritage of American Descendants of Slavery and post-emancipation Freedmen. This means documentation follows a direct line: people whose ancestors were enslaved in what became the United States, who remained here, whose families built communities and culture across centuries on this land.</p>

        <p>When I visit a monument, I photograph it and research its context. When I attend an exhibition, I document what's on display and why it matters. When I find historical photos or documents, I preserve and share them with proper context.</p>

        <p>This isn't genealogy research or academic scholarship. It's field work. It's memory preservation. It's showing what exists before it's forgotten.</p>

        <h2>What Makes This Different</h2>

        <p>Most heritage narratives emphasize either struggle or assimilation. This archive emphasizes building and creating. Not to minimize the brutality of slavery or segregation, but to recognize that survival itself was an act of resistance - and what emerged from that survival was profound.</p>

        <p>We built literal infrastructure: railroads, buildings, agricultural systems. We created legal frameworks through court challenges that expanded rights for everyone. We invented musical forms that became the foundation of American culture. We established institutions that still stand today.</p>

        <p>That story deserves documentation with the same weight given to other founding populations. Not as a subcategory of "African-American studies" but as American history, period.</p>

        <h2>The Continuity Argument</h2>

        <p>Here's something rarely acknowledged: Black Americans today are often more genealogically connected to the founding era than most white Americans are.</p>

        <p>The enslaved population remained continuous - born here, reproducing here, tied to this land across generations. Meanwhile, the white population was transformed by massive immigration waves (1880s-1960s). Ellis Island-era arrivals and their descendants now comprise the majority of white Americans.</p>

        <p>This means modern white Americans largely descend from people who arrived after the country was already built. Black Americans descend from people who built it.</p>

        <p>That's not a moral claim. It's a historical and demographic fact. And it matters when talking about who has legitimate claim to American identity and whose contributions deserve recognition.</p>

        <h2>My Approach</h2>

        <p>This is a one-person project. I document what I encounter when I encounter it. Some weeks that's a monument in Richmond. Some weeks it's an exhibition in DC. Some weeks it's a historical photo I came across.</p>

        <p>I'm not trying to be comprehensive. I'm not competing with other heritage projects. I'm simply creating a record of what I find significant, preserving it digitally, and sharing it for anyone who wants to explore.</p>

        <p>The goal is simple: contribute to a more complete understanding of who built America and what that means for how we see ourselves today.</p>
